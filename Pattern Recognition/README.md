## Programming Assignment: Collinear Points

### Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.

Given a set of n distinct points in the plane, find every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points.

__Performance requirements.__

BruteCollinearPoints: The order of growth of the running time of your program should be n^4 in the worst case and it should use space proportional to n plus the number of line segments returned.

FastCollinearPoints: The order of growth of the running time of your program should be n^2 log n in the worst case and it should use space proportional to n plus the number of line segments returned.
